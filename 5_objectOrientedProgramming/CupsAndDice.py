For this problem you will use the classes from the previous problem diceAndCups to build a game.

The game will work as follows:

1. Greet the user and ask their name.
2. Provide the user with a balance of 100 dollars.
3. Ask them if they would like to play a game.
4. Generate a random number between 1 and 100. This number will be called the goal.
5. Ask the user how much they would like to bet. This money is deducted from their account.
6. Ask the user how many of each die they would like to roll.
7. Create a cup filled with dice according to the userâ€™s input.
8. Roll the cup and display the results.
9. If the roll exactly matches the goal, the user receives 10x bet added to their balance.
10. Otherwise, if the roll is within 3 of the goal but not over, the user receives 5x bet added to their
balance.
11. Otherwise, if the roll is within 10 of the goal but not over, the user receives 2x bet added to their
balance.
12. Report the results to the user. The message should include their name and updated balance.
13. Ask if they would like to play again. If so, go to step 4.
